# Data Isolation

The Schemapack library provides tooling to isolate individual resources and their dependencies from larger datasets. This is useful for partial extraction, targeted validation, or incremental processing.

It creates a rooted datapack that contains only the specified resource and all its dependencies, e.g., the resulting datapack will only contain resources referenced by the root resource as well as the root resource itself.

<div style="border: 1px solid #007acc; border-left: 4px solid #007acc; padding: 1em; border-radius: 6px; background: transparent; margin-bottom: 1em;">
  <strong>Note:</strong> The isolated <code>datapack</code> will not be compatible with the original non-rooted schemapack anymore.
</div>

Example

```bash
schemapack isolate-resource \
    --schemapack ./examples/example_schemapack.yaml \
    --datapack ./examples/example_datapack.yaml \
    --class-name Experiment \
    --resource-id exp1 \
```

Isolated output for class `Experiment` and resource `exp1`:


```yaml
datapack: 3.0.0
resources:
  Sample:
    sample1:
      content:
        name: Sample 1
        description: This is the first sample.
  Experiment:
    exp1:
      content:
        name: Experiment 1
        description: This is the first experiment.
      relations:
        samples:
          targetClass: Sample
          targetResources:
            - sample1
rootResource: exp1
rootClass: Experiment
```
